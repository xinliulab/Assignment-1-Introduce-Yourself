# Assignment 1 – Introduce Yourself

Welcome to your first assignment!  
This is a chance for us to get to know you a bit — and for you to get comfortable with GitHub Classroom and Codespaces.

---

## ✅ What You Need to Do

1. **Open this repo in Codespaces**  
   Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace** to launch your cloud-based workspace. You don’t need to install anything.

2. **Create your profile**  
   In the root of this repository, create a file named:

```

profile.json

````

Your file should follow this format:

```json
{
  "name": "Jordan Smith",
  "student_id": "FSU20261234",
  "hobbies": ["surfing", "video games", "hiking"],
  "expectation": "I want to understand how operating systems really work!",
  "bio": "I'm a sophomore from Tallahassee who loves sunsets and building things.",
  "photo": "photo.jpg"
}
````

* `hobbies` should be a list of at least one item.
* `bio` should be one or two complete sentences.
* `photo` is the file name of the image you’ll upload (see next step).

3. **Add a photo**
   Upload a headshot or casual photo of yourself to the root folder of this repo. Name it something simple like `photo.jpg`.
   This will not be made public — it stays in your private repository.

4. **Test your file**
   In the terminal (inside Codespaces), run:

   ```
   pytest
   ```

   If the JSON is valid and passes the schema check, you'll see all tests pass ✅.

5. **Submit your assignment**
   Once you're done:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Finished HW1"
   git push
   ```

## 💡 Notes

* Use **valid JSON syntax**: make sure to use double quotes, commas between items, and no trailing commas.
* Write in **English**. This helps standardize and test your input.
* This repo is private. Only the instructor and TAs can see your content.

Let’s have a great semester together at FSU 😎
