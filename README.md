# Assignment 1 – Introduce Yourself + Practicum Availability

Welcome to your first assignment.
This is a quick way for us to get to know you and to make sure you are comfortable with GitHub Classroom and Codespaces.

---

## ✅ What You Need to Do

### 1) Open this repo in Codespaces
Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace** to launch your cloud-based workspace.
You don’t need to install anything locally.

### 2) Fill in your `profile.json`
A `profile.json` file is already provided in the root folder of this repository.

Open it and **edit only the following fields**:
- `name`
- `student_id`
- `hobbies`
- `photo`
- `practicum_availability` (mark `true` or `false` for each date)

Example format:

```json
{
  "name": "Jordan Smith",
  "student_id": "FSU20261234",
  "hobbies": ["surfing", "video games", "hiking"],
  "photo": "photo.jpg",
  "practicum_availability": {
    "2026-01-20 (Tue)": true,
    "2026-01-22 (Thu)": false
  }
}
```

### 3) Upload a photo
Upload one photo to the **root folder** of this repo.

- It can be a headshot or a casual life photo.
- Pet photos are welcome too.
- Any photo you think is “cool” is fine.
- Name it something simple like `photo.jpg` (or `photo.png`).
- Make sure the `photo` field in `profile.json` matches your file name.


## ✅ Submission (Commit + Push)

After you update `profile.json` and upload your photo, you must **commit and push** your changes.

In Codespaces (VS Code in the browser):

1. Click the **Source Control** icon on the left sidebar  
   (it looks like a small branch with dots).
2. You should see your changed files (e.g., `profile.json` and your photo).
3. Type a short message like: `Assignment 1`
4. Click **Commit**.
5. Click **Push** (or **Sync Changes**) to upload your work to GitHub.

If you only commit but do not push, we may not see your submission.
